      <p>So Giannis was drafted by the Bucks in 2013 and was not good at first but now he is. Maybe it's because he got stronger and had more experience in the NBA, but I'd prefer to think it's because of his introduction to smoothies.</p>
</section>
<section class="section4">
      <p>I don't know what else to write about. The Bucks are really good this year, they hit 60 wins which hasn't happened for a while and they had the most double-digit wins of any team in the NBA, and in the top 5 of all time.</p>
      <p>I've been a fan of Giannis since he was drafted as a lanky 19 year old from Greece, but now he is a big 24 year old man who is still from Greece but he lives in Milwaukee sometimes when he wants.</p>
      <p>I seriously am at a loss for words right now. Don't know what else to write but need to occupy space so the grid makes more sense. This is mostly jibberish. I could write more about Giannis but I don't want to be wrong and spread misinformation so I'm gonna abstain from that.</p>
      <p>Recently I've been getting into biking, which is cool cuz it's good exercise. Plus the weather is better so it's not only healthy for cardivascular reasons, but that sweet, sweet vitamin D.</p>

      <p>Ok you're still reading that's cool. Now that you're here, I'd like to let you in on a secret. Are you tired of working a 9-5 boring job every day? I make hundreds of dollars every day sitting at home being my own boss. And you can too! But first, I'm going to need the 16 digits on the front of your credit card, along with the month and year of expiration and 3 digits on the back.</p>
</section>
<section class="section5">
      <p>You better do it before the Bucks have their playoff game! This is the only way you can help Giannis lead the Bucks to a championship. Don't ask your mom if it's ok to give out this information, she already told me it's ok.</p>
      <p>Also if you know the 9 digits to your social security number that will help Giannis too! Don't delay! He needs all the help he can get! Khris Middleton just got injured, and Brook Lopez forgot how to shoot again! NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.</p>
